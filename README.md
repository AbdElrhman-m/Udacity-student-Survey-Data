# [Udacity-student-Survey-Data](https://github.com/AbdElrhman-m/Udacity-student-Survey-Data/)

In this project, analyzed a real dataset about current Udacity students across a number of programs, 
so it isn't perfect. It was a little messy (some things are input incorrectly, others were missing).
needed to decide how to analyze the data and then communicate your findings about it.
used spreadsheets to make your analysis easier.
